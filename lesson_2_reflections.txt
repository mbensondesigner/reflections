What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it adds a .git. then you need to tell the .git which files you want to keep together in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area shows what the next commit will include. i think this will help maybe when deciding when to make a commit.
