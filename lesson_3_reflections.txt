When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If/when you are collaborating with other people!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

perhaps if you're working with other people, and you're both working on the same problem, you don't want their solutions/work to interfere with your own. altho hopefully you'd be working on separate branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are clones made on github, clones are clones made from git hub to a local, or local to local. branches are experiments that you don't want to commit to the master just yet. you would use forks when making your own version of a github project or collaborating and wanting to be able to show how to make yoru changes..

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

incase it gets broken in a new commit, you can view the diffs and edit the file locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

well i've already done it and it was a mess, but i think github may have been too complex to learn to actually use in the scenario. we had a file naming convention that involved writing the date in a specific way. it wasn't a coding project, so perhaps it was good enough. there should be a git for design. lol
